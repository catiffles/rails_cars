Creating a Rails App.

1. Make sure Rails is installed. If not, install it with 'gem install rails'

2. Create a new Rails app with
      rails new hippos_app --database=postgresql
    This creates a bare bones structure to build the app

3. Start up the Rails app with
      rails server
    Then going to http://localhost:3000 to check up on the app whenever changes are made! Also helps with finding all the errors to fix them right away.

4. Create a database with
      rake db:create
    This is where all info will be stored. The database is empty for now.

5. Build a route so the app can process the path to /name_app by opening up the config/routes.rb file and adding
      get 'hippos', to: 'hippos#index'
    Now that the app can access index page, it's time to create a controller.

6. We do this by 
      touch app/controllers/hippos_controller.rb
    In this file type in
      class HipposController < ApplicationController
        def index
        end
      end

7. In order to see anything though, we need a template, by creating a view. We do this by first creating a new directory inside app/views named after the app, and creating an index.html.erb file inside the new directory. Can add some random text to test it in the browser.

8. Our database is still empty, so let's create a table for the app. We do this by
      rails generate migration CreateHippos size number_of_teeth age
    Then
      rake db:migrate

9. We still need a model so we can access all the contents in the database. We can do this by
      touch app/models/hippo.rb
    Everything within the model is singular. Including the name of the file! 
    In this new file, add 
      class Hippo < ActiveRecord::Base
      end
    Awesome! Now everything should be connected.

10. Now it's time to fill up the database with actual information. We do this in db/seeds.rb. An example of something you can add in this file is
      1.upto(5) do |x|
        Name.create(age: stuff#{x}, number_of_teeth: morestuff#{x} * 5, size: evenmorestuff#{x} * 10)
    then rake it!
      rake db:seed

11. Back to name_controller.rb, lets fill out the empty method there with
      @hippos = Hippos.all

12. Lastly, go to app/views/name/index.html.erb that you created earlier, and fill out some information about what you want shown in the browser. For example
      <h2>Hippos</h2>
         <ul>
           <% @hippos.each do |hippo| %>
            <li><%= hippo.name %></li>
            <% end %>
          </ul>
